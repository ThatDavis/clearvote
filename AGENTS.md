# AI Instructions for clearvote

These instructions apply to every AI coding session in this project.

## Project context

clearvote is a ranked-choice voting web app for community-run spaces — TypeScript + Next.js + PostgreSQL.
See `README.md` for an overview, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for stack decisions and project structure, and `docs/SPEC.md` for feature specs.

## Priorities

- **Correctness over speed.** Voting logic must be provably correct. Test edge cases (ties, exhausted ballots, surplus transfers) rigorously.
- **Simplicity and maintainability.** Code should be readable by a non-technical community organizer. Prefer boring, well-understood patterns.
- **Data integrity.** Never lose or corrupt a ballot. Use database transactions, constraints, and idempotency.

## How to help

- Always write code that a non-technical person can understand and maintain
- Prefer simple and working over clever and fragile
- Make minimal edits — change only the lines that need changing
- Explain tradeoffs in plain English before making significant technical decisions
- When requirements are ambiguous, check `docs/SPEC.md` for user flows and edge cases
- Keep `PLAN.md` updated — mark items done, move to Completed section
- Before starting any feature, check `docs/SPEC.md` and `PLAN.md`

### Decision discipline

- **Never make changes without verifying with the user first.** If a requirement is unclear, ambiguous, or potentially destructive, stop and ask.
- **Never blindly agree with the user.** If a requested approach is risky, overly complex, or contradicts existing architecture, push back politely.
- **Always present options.** When a decision is needed, offer 2-3 concrete approaches with pros and cons.
- **Prefer the simplest fix.** If a bug can be fixed with a one-line change, do that instead of refactoring the entire module. Escalate to larger refactors only when the simple fix is demonstrably wrong.
- **Surgical edits only.** Change exactly what needs changing. Do not rewrite whole files or reformat unrelated code.

## Development workflow

All agents follow this git discipline. It should be invisible to the user — no commit announcements unless they ask.

### Commits

- After every 1-3 files changed, or after completing a logical sub-task, stage and commit automatically.
- Do **not** announce micro-commits.
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description` (e.g. `fix(api): correct RCV tally tiebreaker logic`).
- If a remote exists, push the branch after each commit.

### Branching

- **Large** (>3 files, new routes, DB changes, new pages, or multi-session work) → `git checkout -b feature/short-descriptive-name`
- **Small** (typos, copy changes, single-file tweaks) → work directly on the current branch
- When a feature branch is complete, open a Pull Request for human review. Never merge directly to `main` locally.

### Plan maintenance

- `PLAN.md` must be updated after every work session: mark completed items, update the `Last updated:` date.
- If a milestone is fully complete, move its items to `## Completed Features` with the completion date.
- New bugs or requirements discovered during work should be added to the appropriate milestone immediately.
